# Computational-Inteligence
It is my favorite repository :)


### KNN $ SVM
I tried to implement KNN from scratch and implement SVM using library.
In this file i also uploaded the dataset we need to train and test on.

### BTCPrice
In this file i uploaded BTC price dataset and i tried to build a model which is predcting bitcoin price in n future days.

### Image Classify
As it is obvious i tried to implement a model in pytorch which classify face expression into 7 classes.
The preprocess step here is really important because we just had picture's pixels in a dataframe.


## CI-proj
In this folder there is dataset which is a csv form of customer's comments for a product and now we want to classify that product as recommended or non-recommended. So there is a code to implement a NLP project which is using some libraries to know either a text is positive or negetive.
Then it tags that text in recommended or non-recomended class.
