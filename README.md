It is my favorite repository :)


### KNN $ SVM
I tried to implement KNN from scratch and implement SVM using library.
In this file i also uploaded the dataset we need to train and test on.

### BTCPrice
In this file i uploaded BTC price dataset and i tried to build a model which is predcting bitcoin price in n future days.

### Image Classify
As it is obvious i tried to implement a model in pytorch which classify face expression into 7 classes.
The preprocess step here is really important because we just had picture's pixels in a dataframe.
